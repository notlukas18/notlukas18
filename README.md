# Hola, World! I'm Javohir 👋
![Profile Views](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=notlukas18&color=blue)

I'm a Software Developer, with a passion for bringing ideas to life. Growing up in the early 2000s, I fell in love with the internet, inspired by my experiences and interest in AI and mobile app development, I aim to build digital solutions that are both efficient and accessible to users. I specialize in Kotlin and Python for creating apps and data-driven projects.
Currently, I’m expanding my knowledge in DevOps and containerization with Docker, diving deeper into tools like GitHub to streamline development and improve deployment workflows.

Beyond coding, metal music is my go-to genre, and I love exploring both the intensity and artistry within it. Whether I’m gaming, discovering new music, or appreciating different art forms, I believe that creativity is key to everything I do ✨

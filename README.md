I'm a Software engineering student, with a passion for bringing ideas to life.

## 📃 I Love Documentation
Not many developers like to write documentation, but I do. I believe that a well-documented codebase is as important as the code itself. It’s like a story, telling what the code can do and how it works. I always try to write clear, concise, and useful documentation. My go-to documentation tool is [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/).

In addition, I'm working on a custom Obsidian theme as part of my Violet Void series. This theme features rich, deep purple colors with transparency effects, providing a sleek and modern look. I plan to release it soon so others can enjoy it as well.

### Whenever I write documentation, I follow these principles:
- **What** is this documentation about?
- **Why** is this documentation important?
- **How** can the reader use it?
- **When** should it be used?
- **Who** is it for?

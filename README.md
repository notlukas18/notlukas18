![Profile Views](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=notlukas18&color=blue)

I'm a Software Developer, with a passion for bringing ideas to life. Growing up in the early 2000s, I fell in love with the internet, inspired by my experiences and interest in AI and mobile app development, I aim to build digital solutions that are both efficient and accessible to users. I specialize in Kotlin and Python for creating apps and data-driven projects.

Currently, I’m expanding my knowledge in DevOps and containerization with Docker, diving deeper into tools like GitHub to streamline development and improve deployment workflows.

I'm a Software Developer on a mission to make ideas click into reality. The internet hooked me back in the early 2000s, and now, inspired by that magic, I’m into building sleek, powerful digital solutions. From AI to mobile app development, I’m all about making tech that’s both efficient and user-friendly. My main tools? Kotlin and Python for apps and data-driven projects. Right now, I’m diving into DevOps and containerization with Docker, plus getting GitHub-savvy to power up my workflows.

Outside of the code, metal music is my jam—I’m all about the intensity and artistry. Whether I’m gaming, finding new tunes, or just exploring different art styles, creativity is at the core of everything I do! ✨

Hey there! I’m a Software Developer who’s all about turning big ideas into reality. Growing up in the golden era of the early internet, I was fascinated by how tech connects people, and now I’m here to build digital tools that make life smoother, smarter, and way more exciting. I’m all about AI and mobile app development, with Kotlin and Python as my weapons of choice for creating slick, data-powered apps. Right now, I’m leveling up in DevOps and containerization with Docker, digging deep into GitHub to amp up my workflows and deploy with ease.

But I’m not just about the code—metal music is my vibe, bringing the intensity and soul I crave. Whether I’m gaming, binging on new music, or exploring all kinds of art, I’m driven by creativity in everything I do. If it’s about pushing boundaries or discovering fresh perspectives, count me in.✨

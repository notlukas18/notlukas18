Hey fam! I’m a Software Dev out here tryna make big moves and bring ideas to life. I grew up in the OG internet days, and now, I’m hooked on building digital tools that make life hit different. I’m super into AI and mobile app dev, using Kotlin and Python to drop next-level, data-powered apps. Lately, I’m deep in my DevOps and Docker era, plus getting all the GitHub skills to streamline my workflows like a pro.

Outside the code grind, metal music is my whole mood—nothing but vibes and pure energy. Catch me gaming, vibing to new tracks, or getting lost in all kinds of art. For me, it’s all about being creative and going off with whatever I’m doing. If it’s giving fresh takes, I’m all in. Let’s get it! ✨

### [Vintage Haven](https://github.com/notlukas18/Vintage-Haven) 🧸
[Vintage Haven](https://github.com/notlukas18/Vintage-Haven) is all about creating a treasure trove for anyone who loves finding unique, one-of-a-kind pieces with a story. It's designed to bring a smooth, almost nostalgic shopping experience, letting users browse and discover vintage gems at their own pace. From timeless pieces to unexpected finds, every item feels like a mini time capsule. My team and I have focused on keeping the whole vibe true to the vintage aesthetic, with a layout and functionality that just feels right. It’s built to be a digital haven for people who don’t just shop—they curate their lives with style and soul.
